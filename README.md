# Face-recognition-and-identification

-Opencv has the ability to train a recognizer, this is where we could use a deep learning model to predict things as well. There are: tensorflow, scikit-learn, pi-torch, keras. 
-First need to get built-in haarcascade classifier.
-There is a pillow library which is the python image library to import the train images 
-The images convert into Numpy array 
-Than the person images folder needs to be Label as it is are going to declare the specific person  
-Label declare specific ID for each person
-OpenCV provides three methods of face recognition: Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces, Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) 
-In LBPH each images is analyzed independently
-After training complete, we can Identify the person face and with his/her name in real time video and Image 
-We can also detect eyes and smile using cascade classifier
