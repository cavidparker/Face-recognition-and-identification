# Face-recognition-and-identification

-Opencv has the ability to train a recognizer, this is where we could use a deep learning model to predict things as well. There are: tensorflow, scikit-learn, pi-torch, keras. 
-First need to get built-in haarcascade classifier.
-There is a pillow library which is the python image library to import the train images 
-The images convert into Numpy array
